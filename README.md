## Chit: Crate help in terminal

A command-line tool for looking up details about rust crates without going to crates.io.


### Chit helps answer these questions:
  - Who wrote this crate? What else did they write?
  - What alternatives are there for this crate?
  - How old is this crate?
  - What versions are there? When did they come out?
  - What are the download numbers over time?
  - Should I use this crate? 
  - How mature is it? <Star rating>
  

### Installation

Cargo installed already? `cargo install chit`.

If not... find out [how to install cargo!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

#### Nix package manager

 - [x] Add another command e.g. `chit repo` which might get meta data like stars and collaborator numbers etc
 - [ ] Change error handling to use result types
 - [ ] Use some more functional programming techniques to cut the code size down
 - [ ] distribute through brew, apt-get, etc...
 - [ ] expand the repository details returned by the `repo` command
